# Crates provided

Youki repo itself is a Cargo workspace, comprising of several sub-crates, each one for some specific functionality. The youki binary depends on this to provide the low-level functionality, and you can use these crate as a dependency for your own projects as well.

For more information on how to add a sub-crate as a dependency in your project, see [Basic Usage](./basic_usage.md).

The subsection in this part briefly explains some of the crates, and some of the functionality they expose. This should be good enough to get a general idea of each crate. To get detailed information about the structs, functions and modules each crate exposes, unfortunately, for the time being, you will need to go through the source itself, but we are working on creating better docs.
